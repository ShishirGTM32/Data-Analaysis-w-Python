# Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains two main components for data analysis using Python. Below is an overview of the work done:

## 1. **Statistics Calculator**

**File:** `Statistics_Calc.py`

This Python script is designed to calculate various statistical metrics for a given 3x3 matrix of data. It can compute the following statistics for each column, row, and the entire matrix:

- **Mean**
- **Median**
- **Mode**
- **Standard Deviation**
- **Variance**
- **Range**


## 2. **Product Sales Analysis**

**File:** ` Product_Sales_Analysis.py`

**CSV File:** `Order_details.csv` 

This Python script performs an analysis on a sales report of a shop. It takes data from a CSV file (Order_details.csv) that contains details about customer orders and product sales. The analysis provides insights into: 

- **Total sales per product**
- **Revenue by product**
- **Top-selling products** 
- **Sales trends over time**
