# Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains two main components for data analysis using Python. Below is an overview of the work done:

## 1. **Statistics Calculator (3x3 Matrix)**

**File:** `Statistics_Calc.py`

This Python script is designed to calculate various statistical metrics for a given 3x3 matrix of data. It can compute the following statistics for each column, row, and the entire matrix:

- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Standard Deviation
- Variance
- Range

You can input a 3x3 matrix of numeric values, and the script will calculate and display the results.

### Features:
- Takes a 3x3 matrix as input.
- Computes common statistical measures.
- Handles basic edge cases (e.g., non-numeric values).
  
### Example:

```python
# Sample 3x3 matrix input
matrix = [
    [5, 12, 7],
    [3, 8, 6],
    [10, 2, 9]
]
